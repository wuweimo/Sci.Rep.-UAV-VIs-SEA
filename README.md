# Sci.Rep.-UAV-VIs-SEA
Visible-light UAV remote sensing datasets of cotton fields under different solar elevation angles in three days, accompanied by Python scripts for computing 13 vegetation indices (VIs).

The UAV imagery and Python scripts in this GitHub repository were used in the paper 
"Effects of solar elevation angle on visible light vegetation indices derived from UAV-based cotton field monitoring" will be published in Scientific Reports.

When you open the GitHub repository named "Sci.Rep.-UAV-VIs-SEA", please click Branches, then master, and click the downward arrow icon to the right of the Code button, 
and select Download ZIP to download the files to your local computer. 
The compressed file will be named Sci.Rep.-UAV-VIs-SEA-master.zip. After extraction, it will generate a folder called UAV-images_and_Python_Scripts.

Upon navigating through the map and rasters subdirectories, you will find three subfolders:

Python_scripts

rasters_I-1

rasters_I-5

The Python_scripts subfolder contains two additional subfolders: plotI-1 and plotI-5. Within plotI-1, there are three date-labeled folders: 
20230826, 20230831, and 20230901, corresponding to August 26, August 31, and September 1, 2023. 
These folders store visible-light remote sensing orthomosaic images of cotton field experimental plot I-1, captured by a UAV and reconstructed using DJI Terra software.

Each date folder includes a text file containing Python scripts for calculating vegetation indices (VIs) from 12 hourly visible-light UAV images (captured from sunrise to sunset). 
Every UAV image has a dedicated script for computing its vegetation indices.

In the rasters_I-1 folder, there are three subfolders: 20230826_differentSEA, 20230831_differentSEA, and 20230831_differentSEA, 
each containing 12 TIFF files representing rasterized UAV visible-light images. Additionally, a subfolder named 20230826-10-I-1 includes:

Three single-band TIFF files (*_band1.tif, *_band2.tif, *_band3.tif)

13 single-band visible vegetation index TIFF files (e.g., *_ExB.tif)

A CSV file named 20230826-10-I-1-stat.csv, containing statistical values of 13 vegetation indices extracted/computed from 
the UAV image of plot I-1 captured at 10:00 on August 26, 2023.

All files in the 20230826-10-I-1 folder were generated by running Python scripts in the ArcMap Python console.
